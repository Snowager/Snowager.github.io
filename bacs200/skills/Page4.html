        <p> I used to have a pet named Sparky. I got him along with his bowl at a secondhand shop in downtown LA. The owner was pretty nice, and he even helped me to pick out special food since apparently sparky's species was known to have diet issues (Marmorated stinkbug legs. Thankfully they were dessicated to the point where they didn't smell like anything more than slightly-off sawdust). Sparky was some kinda lizard, that's really all I knew. Even the petshop owner didn't know his species. A rare find! Once I got home, I found out quickly he loved to sleep a lot! Sometimes I would have to tap the glass (don't do this to your own pets, I learned later this was a bad practice) to see if he was still alive, I was totally a scared new pet owner, ha. So many times I came in and saw him sitting with his side to me, blowing light-green bubbles (Yellow would be a healthier color I know, but his diet issues were interfering with the natural pigment). But the moment I brought out his food he perked right up!</p>
        <p> Eventually we got to the point were we woudn't mind me holding him out of his tank . For the longest time he wouldn't let me hold him. To get around it, I would get a bag of stinkbugs (imported from China, sparky's tastes were expensive) and put them outside his tank. He would crawl up to the tank glass to watch me. He had a strange habit of sitting down on a small clump of coral near the front of the tank, but propped up on his limbs. Yeah, he was a little derpy sometimes. He would usually do this when I was getting his food ready (I think the bugs squealing attracted his attention. I couldn't get him to eat the legs alone after the first time we came home from the tankshop. It was probably desperation that made him eat the legs in such a bad condition, or maybe even stress from being put in a temp tank while I shopped. Whatever the reason, he would only recognize and eat the legs now if they moved around, which meant I had to buy LIVE bugs - yuck - and take a pin to hold them in place while I used a small scalpel to cleanly remove the limbs.). It turns out, kinda like birds, I could get him to sit in my hand by putting food in it (which meant holding a pile of those...yup.) and placing it flat on the bottom of the tank. Was it gross? EXTREMELY! But after a while the worst it would feel like was strange tickling, and sparky always ate them down like he was starving. Despite feeding him once every 2 hours. If I didn't feed him enough I'd find out later.</p>
        <p>Turns out sparky didn't only like stinkbug legs. If I didn't feed him enough (my poor wallet, seriously China imports cost a fortune, and I couldn't buy in bulk because they wouldn't live long enough and I was not gonna risk an outbreak of stinkbugs in my room) he would get antsy and nibble on his furniture. With my budget devoted to bugs, I could only afford chintsy stuff (a mermaid with half a fin, a Hannah-Barbara haunted-diver figurine that collected ivy like no one's business, and a few scattered monkeys in diver suits because I thought it was funny.) and at this point they were chewtoys more than anything. It was mostly cosmetic damage, save one poor seamonkey next to the filter that I found decapitated one morning, her head freely bobbing at the top of the water, bouyed by bubbles. Once he got used to my hand, he'd even nibble me sometimes! Thankfully he was tiny, and I never bled for long (the things we do for love). When he did that, I'd only leave him half the legs I normally give him as a punishment. He'd be mad at first, but eventually he'd settle down, and start blowing his green bubbles again. I found that for some reason, on punishment days, he wouldn't sleep with his side to me like usual. Instead, when i woke up I'd see him on that coral patch, sitting down and staring out the tank, having sat there all night long. Occasionally I'd wake up to use the bathroom, and the room would be lit with a green hue from his bubbles. Ominous at first, but really just a more convenient nightlight. And then he'd be fine from that morning on, all smiles, and bubbles, and lazing around. Had he not attacked my parakeet, I think we would have learned to behave at some point too.</p>
        <p>So, some more context, I used to keep parakeets too. But bad things kept happening. The first few got mauled by raccoons when their cage was left by my open window when I left one weekend to stay over at a friends. They were a family: a father, young boy, and the mom. The day I returned I found the mom shivering in the far corner with her son in front as if to protect her. I'd later come to find that the raccoon tried to get her too, and she had a gouge under her left wing. The dad was a sticky clump stuck to the front bars. At first I thought he was imitating Sparky, but the ruddy red streaked on the bars near his body told me otherwise. He was headless, and the amount of damage meant it had been ripped off with effort, presumably when the raccoon tried to pull him through the cage bars. From that point, the mom and her son (Tawnya and Mr. Bird, I'm not that clever. The father was Ricky.) hung out in my room, and when I cleaned their cage I let them fly around the room, making sure to lock the windows and doors. They wouldn't get into too much trouble, generally just pooping on random items and squawking in fear if they fell on the floor and got separated, now that Ricky was gone. They never trusted me again after that incident, and I don't blame them. I thought after having Sparky for a little while I could handle something that wasn't always locked up, but I was wrong. On both accounts.</p>
        <p>Maybe I should have fed him more often. Maybe I should have kept the tank closed better. I think about it still, the absurdity of a small amphibian not only getting out, but going after a bird. A week after the raccoon incident, the mom finally died. She had taken a fancy to fly up to my curtains above Sparky's tank and roost up on the curtain bar. She had gotten angrier too. She frequently snapped at Mr. Bird, attacked him for his share of the pellets, was constantly molting her feathers everywhere, and the feathers she still had she kept pulling at herself. I found them all over my room, and several in the tank which, while Sparky might have found fun, certainly didn't help his existing health issues. But the worst was how much she shrieked at Sparky. When he was sitting down on his coral patch, watching out the tank, I'd always know, because she would start shrieking as loud as she could at the tank. And then she finally died. I was out of the room when I hear her yell out, her voice more raw and louder than ever. Then, a loud splash. I quickly ran back to my room, fearing the worst.</p>
        <p>I looked up to her old post, my curtain bar, but she wasn't there, only the normal scratch marks where she clenched on to stay up in her age. Her body was instead in the tank, a yellow submarine descending steadily to the pebble depths. Her once-beautiful crest was a ragged baldcap; her body was practically stripped clean. That's when I made a mistake. Mr. Bird was squeaking the whole time, using the same cadence for when they would get stuck on the floor, alone. So I grabbed him and ushered him back in the cage, locking and covering it with a cloth (I don't know if it mattered if he could see, he was still squeaking the whole time afterward). By the time I got back to the tank, Sparky had gotten to the corpse. He was trying to eat her leg, thinking I'm sure she was a weird new bug. I plunged my hand in without thinking to grab her body. A glove would've been smart, but I was more worried about two pets potentially dying in one day. And then I felt a warm needling jolt. I yanked my fist out with her cold stiff body. I opened my hands to see a mess as her stomach was bloated with water, her eyes glassed over, and her feathers were a yellow-pink soppy mess of stained blood. Had he tried the body too? No, on closer inspection, I was the one bleeding. Sparky had bit me. Hard.</p>
        <p>I got a bandaid that seemed to do nothing and grabbed a few bugs. I wasn't gonna risk him getting antsy again, not with everything else today. The legs calmed him down, and I held a makeshift funeral for Tawnya that night. She was buried in a shoebox in the yard next to Ricky. The atmosphere seemed to change after that day. Mr. Bird cried out less, eventually stopping his chirping completely. He stayed in the cage, refusing to leave. I had to move the food bowl and the water to his side, because he also refused to move. He stayed on the far end of the cage at all times. Away from the window, or maybe away from the tank. He also would not sleep without a cloth on the cage anymore. If I forgot to cover his cage and turned off the lights, he'd start shrieking like his mom did in the dark. As for Sparky, he now spent all of his time near the front of his tank, and every night on his coral patch. I'd like to think he was just keeping watch after everything horrible, his eyes scanning the dark for monsters. But after so many nights with only the lurid green of his luminant bubbles in the silence, my mind coudn't help but drift toward sinister ministrations. Such thoughts lead steadily to night terrors, of dull green skies, and the muted sound of bubbles escaping from the dark below.</p>
