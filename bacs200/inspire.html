        Captain America may not be real, but the principles and intentions behind his actions are real enough to make him a hero to me.
        Captain America stands for a conceptual justice, much like Superman, where good always wins in the end. the difference between them, however, is that Superman is an almost <strong>invincible</strong> alien being whereas Captain America is just a supersoldier whose only power is his <em>unbreakable conviction</em>. It's the fact that even with far more to lose, both physical and emotionally, Captain America continues to fight for the powers of good that makes him my hero.

    <p>
        Some of the heroic actions that Captain America has done in the past include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Working tirelessly to save his friend Bucky Barnes.</li>
        <li>Helping to defeat Thanos and protect the Earth.</li>
        <li>And the best one, being deemed worthy enough to wield Mjolnir, Thor's Hammer that can only be used by those pure of heart and noble in their intentions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite being a figure of fiction, Captain America's realistic ability to keep hope no matter the odds makes him a consistent soource of inspiration for me. To always fight the good fight, against oppression, against hatred, against tyranny, and against all odds.</p>
